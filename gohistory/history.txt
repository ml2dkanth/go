Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. 
The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.

It provides garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capability, many advanced built-in types such as variable length arrays and key-value maps.
It also provides a rich standard library

The tools provided by Go allows you to use memory and manage all the available objects efficiently.
